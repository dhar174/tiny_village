"""
Validation test for the test counting logic fix.

This test validates that the fix correctly addresses the issue where 
test counting logic artificially manipulates results by treating 
multiple unittest methods as a single test unit.

ISSUE FIX: Replaced artificial self.fail() calls with genuine functional tests
that validate real behavior and can fail based on actual functionality.
