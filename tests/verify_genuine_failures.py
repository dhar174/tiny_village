Test to verify that our new functional tests can genuinely fail.
This demonstrates that the tests are not artificial and actually validate real functionality.

IMPROVEMENT: Instead of importing nonexistent modules (which tests the Python import system),
this version imports actual codebase modules and tests them with intentionally wrong expectations
to demonstrate genuine failure scenarios while testing real functionality.
