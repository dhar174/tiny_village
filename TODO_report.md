### C. Key Areas for Completion in Controller
- **Event Processing**: The `_process_pending_events` method is a placeholder. A robust system for handling different event types, dispatching them, and managing their consequences on game state and character AI is needed. The documented flow of `EventHandler` triggering `StrategyManager` needs to be implemented in the main game loop.
- **Game Loop Enhancements**: Many TODOs point to needed features like performance profiling, dynamic FPS adjustment, state persistence/checkpointing, and real-time config updates.
- **Input Handling**: Needs to be made more sophisticated, with support for various input methods and customization.
- **System Integration**: Ensure all game systems (AI, world, events) are correctly updated and interact within `update_game_state` as per the documented architecture. The legacy `update()` method should be merged or deprecated.
- **Error Handling and Recovery**: While `SystemRecoveryManager` exists, its strategy of re-initializing systems might be too basic for maintaining game state. More nuanced recovery or error prevention is needed.
- **Feature Implementation**: Many feature systems (weather, social, quests, economy) are initialized via `implement_..._system` methods but are stubs. The controller needs to correctly call update methods on these systems once they are fleshed out.

## II. Character AI & Systems

### A. `tiny_characters.py`
- Current State: The `Character` class is comprehensive, defining attributes for basic info, core stats, job, social aspects, goals, location, inventory, personality, motives, and skills. It includes methods for state calculations, goal/memory management, basic movement, and personality-driven decision helpers.
- TODOs/Gaps:
    - **History**: While `recent_event` exists, a more structured long-term history could be beneficial, perhaps integrated more deeply with the memory system.
    - **Likes/Dislikes**: Explicit definition of likes/dislikes is missing; these currently would emerge from other traits/memories. Consider adding direct attributes if finer control is needed.
    - **Bank Accounts**: `wealth_money` and `investment_portfolio` are good, but a formal banking system interaction (deposits, loans) is not present.
    - **Behavioral Methods**:
        - `play_animation` is a placeholder.
        - Deeper integration of memory recall (`make_decision_based_on_memories`) into a wider range of decisions.
        - More sophisticated goal generation that considers a wider array of contextual information.
    - **Skill Usage**: Define how skills impact action success, efficiency, or unlock new actions.

### B. `tiny_goap_system.py` (Goal-Oriented Action Planning)
- Current State: Contains a `Plan` class for managing action sequences and a `GOAPPlanner` class. `GOAPPlanner` has a detailed `evaluate_goal_importance` method and helper functions for different goal types. However, its main planning logic is split: a static `goap_planner` method that performs a search but expects actions as dicts, and an instance method `plan_actions` that currently only sorts actions by utility. The `Plan.replan()` method is basic.
- TODOs/Gaps:
    - **Core Planner Logic**: Unify and complete the core GOAP planning algorithm. The static `goap_planner` needs to be integrated as the main instance method for planning, or the instance's `plan_actions` needs to be replaced with a proper search algorithm. It should work with `Action` objects from `actions.py`.
    - **Action Definitions**: Ensure the planner can correctly use `Action` objects with their defined preconditions and effects from `actions.py`.
    - **Integration with Character/World**: The planner needs to dynamically receive the current world state and available actions for the character.
    - **Plan Execution and Robustness**: `Plan.execute()` needs to be robust. `Plan.replan()` needs significant enhancement to handle failures by finding alternative action sequences, not just re-sorting.
    - **Cost Functions**: Properly integrate and utilize action costs in the planning search.
    - **Alignment with `StrategyManager`**: Clarify and fix the interaction between `StrategyManager` and `GOAPPlanner` to ensure `StrategyManager` can request and receive valid plans.

### C. `tiny_memories.py` (Memory Management)
- Current State: A sophisticated system with `Memory`, `GeneralMemory`, `SpecificMemory`, `MemoryBST`, `FlatMemoryAccess`, and `MemoryManager` classes. It includes a detailed NLP pipeline for analyzing memory descriptions (embeddings, sentiment, emotion, keywords, facts). Retrieval uses a global FAISS index in `FlatMemoryAccess`.
- TODOs/Gaps:
    - **BST Usage**: The `MemoryBST` instances within `GeneralMemory` (for timestamp, importance sorting) seem underutilized in the primary retrieval flow, which relies on FAISS. Clarify their role or enhance their integration for filtered/sorted retrieval *within* a general memory.
    - **Memory Coherence**: No explicit mechanism for handling contradictory memories or beliefs.
    - **Integration with Decision-Making**: While `Character.make_decision_based_on_memories` exists, the actual influence of memories on `StrategyManager`'s goal formulation or `GOAPPlanner`'s planning needs to be more deeply implemented as per `documentation_summary.txt`.
    - **Fact Extraction Robustness**: Fact extraction is inherently challenging; continuous improvement will be needed.
    - **Computational Cost**: The extensive NLP processing can be resource-intensive. Optimization might be needed.

### D. `tiny_prompt_builder.py` & LLM Integration
- Current State: `PromptBuilder` uses `DescriptorMatrices` for varied text in prompts. It generates a "daily routine" prompt with character context and hardcoded action choices. `NeedsPriorities` calculates need scores. `TinyBrainIO` handles LLM communication (Transformers or GGUF). `OutputInterpreter` parses expected JSON from LLM into predefined `Action` objects.
- TODOs/Gaps:
    - **Dynamic Action Choices**: Prompts should include dynamically generated and relevant action choices, possibly from `GOAPPlanner` or `StrategyManager`, instead of hardcoded ones.
    - **Integration of Needs/Goals**: Explicitly include character needs priorities and active goals in the prompt text for better LLM guidance.
    - **Diverse Prompt Templates**: Develop templates for various situations (social, crisis, exploration) beyond the daily routine. `generate_crisis_response_prompt` is a stub.
    - **LLM Response Handling**: `OutputInterpreter` expects strict JSON. Need strategies for more flexible LLM outputs or to guide the LLM to always produce the desired JSON. This is a critical point mentioned in `documentation_summary.txt`.
    - **Strategic LLM Calls**: `StrategyManager` should determine when and why to call the LLM, integrating it into the broader AI decision flow (e.g., for complex goals where GOAP is insufficient). This is currently missing.
    - **Conceptual `LLM_Interface`**: Solidify the `LLM_Interface` (PromptBuilder, TinyBrainIO, OutputInterpreter) into a cohesive unit.

### E. `tiny_strategy_manager.py`
- Current State: Has a basic structure for orchestrating strategies (daily activities, job offers). `get_daily_actions` generates and ranks actions by utility. Interaction with `GOAPPlanner` is unclear and likely misaligned with `GOAPPlanner`'s current methods.
- TODOs/Gaps:
    - **GOAP Integration**: Correctly call a functional GOAP planner in `GOAPPlanner` to generate multi-step plans, instead of `get_daily_actions` just selecting single best actions based on immediate utility.
    - **Goal Management**: Implement proper goal formulation and passing of `Goal` objects to `GOAPPlanner` for evaluation and planning.
    - **LLM Integration**: Define how and when `StrategyManager` decides to use LLM prompts for strategic decisions.
    - **Event Handling**: Strengthen the connection with `EventHandler` so that strategies are truly event-driven as per documentation.
    - **Alignment with Architecture**: Refactor to align with `strategy_management_architecture.md` and the data flow in `documentation_summary.txt`, particularly regarding the sequence of operations for decision making.

## III. World Systems & Interactions

### A. `tiny_buildings.py` & Building System
- Current State: `Building` and `House` classes with properties like dimensions, rooms, owner, and calculated values (area, shelter_value, price). A `CreateBuilding` factory can generate buildings, including from custom JSON definitions (as used by `GameplayController`). Basic "Enter Building" interaction defined.
- TODOs/Gaps:
    - **Building Functionality**: Implement distinct functionalities for different `building_type` values (e.g., Market, Tavern, Blacksmith from `GameplayController` defaults). This includes resource production/consumption, services offered.
    - **Interactions**: Expand character interactions with buildings beyond just "Enter Building." Examples: "BuyGoods", "WorkInBuilding", "SocializeInBuilding", "CraftItemAtBuilding". These should be dynamic based on building type.
    - **Ownership**: Flesh out the `owner` attribute effects (e.g., access restrictions, income generation).
    - **Custom Building Loading**: Ensure the loading from `custom_buildings.json` is robust and supports all defined building properties and interactions.

### B. `tiny_map_controller.py` & `tiny_locations.py` (Map & Location System)
- Current State: `MapController` manages a map image, character rendering, and uses `EnhancedAStarPathfinder` for pathfinding on a grid derived from map data (including building footprints and terrain costs). `tiny_locations.py` defines `Location` objects with properties like area, security, popularity, and activities.
- TODOs/Gaps:
    - **Pathfinding Robustness**: Test and refine A* pathfinding, especially with dynamic obstacles and complex map layouts.
    - **Terrain Impact**: Fully utilize terrain costs in `EnhancedAStarPathfinder` to affect character movement speed and path choices beyond just walkability.
    - **Location Integration**:
        -   Ensure `tiny_locations.py` `Location` objects are the primary way specific areas are defined and interacted with, rather than just raw coordinates or rects in `MapController`.
        -   Connect `Building` instances to `Location` instances (e.g., a Building *has a* Location or *is a* Location).
        -   Utilize `Location` properties (`security`, `popularity`, `activities_available`) to influence character AI decisions (e.g., choosing safer or more interesting locations) and event generation.
    - **Points of Interest**: Implement a system for defining and interacting with specific points of interest within locations or on the map that are not buildings (e.g., a park bench, a well).
    - **Map Interactivity**: Expand beyond basic click-to-select/enter. Contextual menus or information panels for locations/buildings.

### C. `actions.py` & Action System
- Current State: Defines `State`, `Condition`, `Action`, `ActionTemplate`, `ActionGenerator`, and `ActionSystem` classes. `Action` objects have preconditions, effects, and cost. Example actions like `TalkAction` and `ExploreAction` exist. `ActionSystem` can generate actions from templates.
- TODOs/Gaps:
    - **Expansion of Actions**: Significantly expand the set of defined `ActionTemplate`s in `ActionSystem.setup_actions()` or directly define more `Action` subclasses to cover a wider range of interactions needed for a feature-complete demo (e.g., related to jobs, items, specific building interactions, social interactions beyond basic "Talk").
    - **Comprehensive Preconditions/Effects**: Ensure preconditions and effects for all actions are detailed and accurately reflect game logic and state changes in `GraphManager`.
    - **`Action.execute()` Implementation**: The base `Action.execute()` is a placeholder. While `GameplayController` handles some execution logic, critical effect applications and `GraphManager` updates related to an action should ideally be encapsulated or triggered more directly by the action's own `execute` method, as suggested by `action_system_deep_dive.md`.
    - **Alignment with `ActionResolver`**: Clarify how `ActionResolver` in `GameplayController` should prioritize using full `Action` objects from `ActionSystem` versus its simpler `_dict_to_action` conversion, to ensure the richness of the defined actions is used.
    - **Cost Balancing**: Review and balance action costs for effective GOAP planning.
    - **Skill Integration**: Integrate `Skill` system with actions, where skills can be preconditions or be improved by performing actions.

## IV. Core Game System Stubs & Placeholders

### A. Event System (`tiny_event_handler.py`)
- Status in Controller: Placeholder System, `event_driven_storytelling` is `NOT_STARTED`.
- Current Implementation: `Event` class is fairly detailed (recurrence, preconditions, effects, cascading). `EventHandler` manages events, can check triggers, process events (basic effect application), and has templates for some event types.
- TODOs/Gaps based on Documentation/Expectations:
    - **Integration with Gameplay Loop**: The main `GameplayController.update_game_state` does not robustly use `EventHandler.check_events()` to drive strategy. The current `_process_pending_events` is insufficient.
    - **Event Impact**: Enhance effect application to have more diverse and significant impacts on character state, world state (`GraphManager`), and relationships.
    - **Event-Driven AI**: Ensure `StrategyManager` and characters react meaningfully to events generated by `EventHandler`.
    - **Content**: Create more event templates and instances that can lead to emergent storytelling.

### B. Item System (`tiny_items.py`)
- Status in Controller: "economic_simulation" is `STUB_IMPLEMENTED`, which relies heavily on items.
- Current Implementation: `ItemObject` base class, `FoodItem` and `Door` subclasses. `ItemInventory` for managing items. Items have value, weight, quantity, type, and can have associated `Action` objects (e.g., "Eat Food").
- TODOs/Gaps:
    - **More Item Types**: Define more item types (tools, resources, clothing, quest items, etc.) with specific properties and interactions.
    - **Item Interactions**: Expand `possible_interactions` for items (e.g., equip tool, wear clothing, use resource for crafting).
    - **Inventory Management**: Enhance UI for inventory, item trading/dropping.
    - **Economic Integration**: Connect item availability, production, and consumption to the `economic_simulation` system. Items should be producible by jobs, consumable for needs, and tradable.

### C. Job System (`tiny_jobs.py`)
- Status in Controller: "economic_simulation" is `STUB_IMPLEMENTED`.
- Current Implementation: `JobRoles` (templates loaded from JSON), `Job` (instance of a role), and `JobManager` to query job details. Defines salary, skills, education requirements.
- TODOs/Gaps:
    - **Character Assignment**: System for characters to apply for, get, and leave jobs.
    - **Job Performance**: Link `job_performance` attribute in `Character` to actual job activities and outcomes.
    - **Job Actions**: Define specific actions related to performing jobs (e.g., "WorkAtFarm", "CraftToolAtBlacksmith"). These actions should consume time/energy and produce resources/value.
    - **Career Progression**: Implement mechanisms for promotions, skill development related to jobs.
    - **Economic Impact**: Jobs should generate income for characters and contribute to the village economy (e.g., producing goods/services).

### D. LLM Interface (`tiny_prompt_builder.py`, `tiny_brain_io.py`, `tiny_output_interpreter.py`)
- Status in Controller: `advanced_ai_behaviors` is `NOT_STARTED`. These files are components of the conceptual LLM interface.
- Current Implementation: Summarized in Section II.D.
- TODOs/Gaps based on Documentation/Expectations:
    - **Dynamic Action Options in Prompts**: Critical for making LLM interaction useful.
    - **Robust Output Parsing**: `OutputInterpreter` needs to handle a wider range of LLM outputs or guide LLM to specific JSON.
    - **Strategic Invocation**: Logic for when and how `StrategyManager` or `Character` decides to use the LLM.
    - **Contextual Richness**: Include more game state (memories, relationships, world events) in prompts.

## V. Specific Features (from `get_feature_implementation_status()`)

### A. Achievement System
- Status: `BASIC_IMPLEMENTED`
- Current State: `GameplayController` has `implement_achievement_system` which sets up a dictionary `self.global_achievements` and checks for a few basic milestones (character count). `Character` objects have an `achievements` set, and `_check_achievements` in `GameplayController` awards based on simple action/state checks.
- TODOs/Gaps for Demo:
    - **Notifications**: Inform the player when an achievement is unlocked.
    - **Persistence**: Save and load earned achievements.
    - **More Complex Conditions**: Implement achievements based on more varied and complex game states or sequences of actions.
    - **Rewards (Optional)**: Consider if achievements should grant any in-game benefit or just be for recognition.

### B. Weather System
- Status: `STUB_IMPLEMENTED`
- Current State: Managed by `self.weather_system` dictionary in `GameplayController`. Basic random weather changes.
- TODOs/Gaps for Demo:
    - **Impact on Gameplay**: Weather should affect character behavior (e.g., seeking shelter in rain), environment (e.g., crop growth), or available actions.
    - **Visual/Auditory Representation**: Basic visual cues (e.g., color overlay, particle effects for rain/snow) and sound effects.
    - **Seasonal Changes**: Implement a cycle of seasons affecting temperature and weather patterns.

### C. Social Network System
- Status: `STUB_IMPLEMENTED`
- Current State: Managed by `self.social_networks` dictionary in `GameplayController`. Basic initialization of random relationship strengths and very slow decay/growth.
- TODOs/Gaps for Demo:
    - **Meaningful Relationship Dynamics**: Actions (especially social ones) should significantly impact relationship strengths.
    - **Influence on Decisions**: Character decisions should be influenced by their relationships (e.g., choosing to help a friend, avoiding an enemy). This requires integration with `StrategyManager` / `GOAPPlanner`.
    - **Social Events**: Implement events that specifically focus on social interactions and relationship building/testing.
    - **Integration with GraphManager**: Ideally, relationship data should be part of the `GraphManager` for centralized access.

### D. Quest System
- Status: `STUB_IMPLEMENTED`
- Current State: Managed by `self.quest_system` dictionary in `GameplayController`. Random assignment from basic templates, simple progress tracking, generic rewards.
- TODOs/Gaps for Demo:
    - **Quest Generation**: More varied and context-aware quest generation (e.g., based on character needs, world events, available items/locations).
    - **Meaningful Objectives & Rewards**: Quests should have clear objectives tied to game mechanics and provide appropriate rewards (items, money, reputation, relationship changes).
    - **Multi-Step Quests**: Implement quests with multiple stages or objectives.
    - **UI for Quests**: Display active and completed quests to the player.
    - **Event Integration**: Quests could be triggered by game events or themselves trigger new events.

### E. Economic Simulation
- Status: `STUB_IMPLEMENTED`
- Current State: Basic wealth changes in `GameplayController._update_economic_state` based on action names. `tiny_items.py` defines item values, `tiny_jobs.py` defines salaries.
- TODOs/Gaps for Demo:
    - **Resource Management**: Define resources, how they are gathered (jobs, actions) and consumed (character needs, crafting).
    - **Marketplace/Trade**: A system for characters to buy/sell goods, either with each other or a central market. Prices could fluctuate based on supply/demand.
    - **Production**: Jobs should produce tangible goods or services that feed into the economy.
    - **Needs-Driven Economy**: Character needs (food, tools) should drive demand for economic activities.
    - **No `tiny_economy_manager.py`**: This system is currently spread across `GameplayController` methods and data in `Items`/`Jobs`. A dedicated manager might be needed.

### F. Save/Load System
- Status: `BASIC_IMPLEMENTED`
- Current State: `GameplayController` has `save_game_state` and `load_game_state` methods that save/load basic game config, stats, and a simplified version of character data to JSON.
- TODOs/Gaps for Demo:
    - **Comprehensive State**: Ensure all critical game state is serialized and deserialized correctly. This includes:
        -   Full character state (all attributes, inventory details, active goals, memories if feasible).
        -   World state (building states, item locations not in inventories).
        -   `GraphManager` state (if it holds dynamic data beyond what's in characters/locations).
        -   Active events, quest progress.
    - **Robustness**: Error handling for corrupted save files or version mismatches.
    - **Memory State**: Saving/loading complex memory structures (FAISS indexes, NLP models in `tiny_memories.py`) is non-trivial and might need specific strategies (e.g., re-indexing on load). The `MemoryManager`'s `save_all_flat_access_memories_to_file` and related methods are a good start but need integration.

### G. Event-Driven Storytelling
- Status: `NOT_STARTED`
- TODOs/Gaps for Demo:
    - Requires a more robust `EventHandler` (see IV.A).
    - Design events that have narrative impact and can chain together to create mini-storylines.
    - Allow character actions and world changes to trigger significant, story-relevant events.

### H. Other NOT_STARTED Features
- **Mod System, Multiplayer Support, Procedural Content Generation, Advanced Graphics Effects, Sound & Music System, Accessibility Features, Performance Optimization, Automated Testing, Configuration UI**: These are significant undertakings, likely beyond the scope of an initial demo but should be kept in mind for future development. For a basic demo, sound/music and performance optimization might be considered earlier.

## VI. UI/UX (User Interface / User Experience)

- Current State: `tiny_gameplay_controller.py`'s `_render_ui` method displays basic information: character count, pause status, game time, weather, game stats, selected character info (name, job, energy, health, basic social/quest info), and static help text. A feature status overlay can be toggled.
- TODOs/Gaps for Demo:
    - **Character Status**: Clear, accessible display of a selected character's crucial needs (hunger, energy), current primary goal, and current action.
    - **Village Overview**: A simple way to see village-wide information (e.g., number of homeless, general mood, active major events).
    - **Interaction Prompts**: Contextual prompts for interactions (e.g., when clicking a building, show available actions).
    - **Feedback**: Visual/textual feedback for actions taken by characters or results of events.
    - **Time Controls**: UI elements to control game speed (pause, play, fast-forward).
    - **Event Notifications**: A system to inform the player about important events occurring in the village.
    - **Improved Help/Tutorials**: More integrated help or a basic tutorial sequence.
    - **Mouse Interaction**: Implement TODOs for mouse interaction handling, right-click context menus, zoom, and scroll.

## VII. Discrepancies with Documentation

- **`StrategyManager` and `GOAPPlanner` Interaction**: The most significant discrepancy. `StrategyManager`'s current implementation of `plan_daily_activities` and `get_daily_actions` deviates from the documented GOAP planning flow. It relies more on direct utility calculation for individual actions rather than using `GOAPPlanner` to form multi-step plans to achieve defined `Goal` objects. The method signatures for calling the planner also seem misaligned.
- **`EventHandler` Integration**: The documented central role of `EventHandler` in triggering `StrategyManager` as part of the main decision cycle is not clearly implemented in `GameplayController.update_game_state`.
- **`Action.execute()`**: `action_system_deep_dive.md` implies `Action.execute()` would handle `GraphManager` updates. Currently, this is more spread out, with `GameplayController` often taking responsibility after an action's simpler `execute` method returns.
- **LLM Integration Points**: While individual LLM components (`PromptBuilder`, `TinyBrainIO`, `OutputInterpreter`) have initial implementations, their strategic integration into the `StrategyManager` or `Character` decision-making loop (as per `documentation_summary.txt` data flow) is missing.
- **`GraphManager` as Single Source of Truth**: While intended, some systems like the social network in `GameplayController` maintain their own state separate from `GraphManager`.

## VIII. General Recommendations & Priorities for Demo

1.  **Fix Core AI Loop (`StrategyManager` <-> `GOAPPlanner`)**: This is fundamental.
    *   Ensure `StrategyManager` correctly formulates `Goal` objects.
    *   Implement a functional GOAP planning algorithm within `GOAPPlanner` (likely by making the static `goap_planner` the main instance method and ensuring it uses `Action` objects).
    *   `StrategyManager` must call this planner and receive a sequence of actions.
2.  **Robust Action Execution**:
    *   Standardize `Action` representation and ensure `ActionResolver` correctly utilizes full `Action` objects from `actions.py`.
    *   Clarify where action effects and `GraphManager` updates are primarily handled (ideally closer to `Action.execute()`).
3.  **Basic Event Integration**:
    *   Ensure `GameplayController.update_game_state` uses `EventHandler.check_events()` to fetch new events.
    *   These events should then be passed to `StrategyManager.update_strategy()` to influence character behavior/planning.
4.  **Implement One or Two Key Systems Fully**: Instead of many stubs, pick core systems and make them work end-to-end for the demo.
    *   **Economy**: Focus on jobs producing income, and characters needing to buy/eat food. This requires `tiny_jobs.py` actions, `tiny_items.py` (food), and basic market/vendor interactions.
    *   **Social Interaction**: Basic "Talk" leading to relationship changes, influenced by personality.
5.  **Clear UI for Character State & Goals**: The player needs to understand what characters are doing and why. Display current needs, the primary goal being pursued, and the current action.
6.  **Refine LLM Usage (Optional for initial demo, but if included)**:
    *   Focus `PromptBuilder` on generating dynamic action choices.
    - Ensure `OutputInterpreter` can reliably parse LLM's chosen action into an executable game action.
