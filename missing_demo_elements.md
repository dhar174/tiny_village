# Missing Elements for Minimal Tiny Village Demo

This repository contains extensive code for the Tiny Village simulation but several required pieces are absent or stubbed out. The following gaps prevent running a minimal playable demo without additional work.

## 1. Entry Point
- **README instructions** mention running `python main.py` but no `main.py` exists in the repository, leaving no clear launch script. See [README.md](README.md#L58-L61) and [related file](path/to/file#L1-L3).
- `tiny_gameplay_controller.py` has an `if __name__ == "__main__"` block but is not referenced in the README.

## 2. Game Assets
- `MapController` expects a map image path when initialized: `pygame.image.load(map_image_path)`【F:tiny_map_controller.py†L10-L13】. The repository lacks an `assets` directory or `default_map.png`, so the controller cannot load the map.

## 3. Dependencies
- Attempting to run the game fails immediately because `pygame` is missing:【5d8ed0†L1-L6】. Requirements also include numerous other packages which must be installed for full functionality.

## 4. Feature and System Stubs
- Many core systems are incomplete or placeholder implementations. `TODO_report.md` lists numerous features marked `NOT_STARTED` or `STUB_IMPLEMENTED` (e.g., `event_driven_storytelling`, `mod_system`, `multiplayer_support`, `advanced_ai_behaviors`).【56e805†L1-L19】【ce5386†L28-L40】 These gaps mean essential gameplay features like event handling, economic simulation, or advanced AI behaviors are missing or minimal.

## 5. Data Files
- Example configuration files `custom_buildings.json` and `custom_characters.json` exist, but there are no default character or building lists for automatic creation. Without these or additional code to generate data, the world starts empty.

## Conclusion
To create a minimal demo, the repository needs:
1. A launch script (or update README to use `python tiny_gameplay_controller.py`).
2. An assets folder with at least a default map image and any basic sprites.
3. Installation of core dependencies like `pygame` and `networkx`.
4. Implementation or simplification of placeholder systems to allow basic character actions, event processing, and map interactions.
