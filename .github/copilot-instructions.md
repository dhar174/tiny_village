When writing tests, do NOT over-mock or fake classes if avoidable. Write tests so that they will fail if the function does not work as expected, do NOT design tests so that they will pass regardless! Good tests fail when there is an error, NEVER manipulate the test design to make it pass while the tested function does not function as expected!

The requirements in requirements.txt are extensive and take up a lot of VM storage space. For this reason, please avoid: a) installing all requirements b) performing testing that may fail due to uninstalled modules (instead, attempt simple unit tests where possible; however BE CAREFUL AND CONSERVATIVE about creating fake or mock classes as this may not correctly test the functions.

Also, be cautious in test design, only design tests to accurately test functions, do NOT design tests meant to pass even if the function isn't doing exactly what it should do! In other words, dont design tests to pass, design tests that will only pass if the tested code works as intended and fail otherwise.
