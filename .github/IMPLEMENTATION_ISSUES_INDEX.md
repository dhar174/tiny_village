# Tiny Village Implementation - GitHub Issues Index

## Quick Reference for GitHub Issue Creation

This document provides a quick reference for creating comprehensive GitHub issues based on the 5 major phases outlined in the Tiny Village IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Title | Priority | Duration | Dependencies | Key Focus |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | Core Decision Loop | CRITICAL | 5 days | None | LLM integration & output parsing |
| 2 | GOAP Planning Integration | HIGH | 4 days | Phase 1 | Strategic planning & goal execution |
| 3 | Event-Driven Storytelling | HIGH | 5 days | Phase 2 | Narrative generation & story arcs |
| 4 | Social Systems | HIGH | 5 days | Phase 3 | Relationships & community dynamics |
| 5 | Polish and Integration | CRITICAL | 5 days | All previous | Testing, optimization & demo |

## Phase Descriptions

### Phase 1: Core Decision Loop Implementation ðŸŽ¯
**Template**: `phase_1_core_decision_loop.md`

**Critical Issue**: Characters cannot make intelligent decisions because the LLM system is disconnected from character turn processing.

**Primary Goals**:
- Complete Output Interpreter for parsing LLM responses (50+ actions)
- Integrate LLM decision-making into character turns
- Establish reliable decision loop: Character â†’ LLM â†’ Action â†’ Memory

**Blocks**: All other AI functionality depends on this foundation

---

### Phase 2: GOAP Planning Integration ðŸ§ 
**Template**: `phase_2_goap_planning_integration.md`

**Critical Issue**: GOAP system exists but isn't integrated, preventing intelligent goal-driven behavior.

**Primary Goals**:
- Complete GOAP system with A* pathfinding
- Integrate GOAP with StrategyManager
- Enable multi-step action planning toward complex goals

**Enables**: Strategic character behavior and complex goal achievement

---

### Phase 3: Event-Driven Storytelling ðŸ“–
**Template**: `phase_3_event_driven_storytelling.md`

**Critical Issue**: Event handler exists but storytelling system is "NOT_STARTED", preventing narrative emergence.

**Primary Goals**:
- Implement story arc management and event detection
- Create narrative coherence tracking
- Enable emergent storytelling from character interactions

**Enables**: Dynamic narrative generation and compelling character arcs

---

### Phase 4: Social Systems ðŸ‘¥
**Template**: `phase_4_social_systems.md`

**Critical Issue**: Social network exists in GraphManager but interaction logic is missing.

**Primary Goals**:
- Implement conversation system with dynamic topics
- Add relationship formation/decay mechanics
- Create group behavior patterns and social influence

**Enables**: Rich community dynamics and social emergence

---

### Phase 5: Polish and Integration âœ¨
**Template**: `phase_5_polish_integration.md`

**Critical Issue**: All systems need integration testing and demo scenarios for successful demonstration.

**Primary Goals**:
- Comprehensive end-to-end integration testing
- Performance optimization and stability fixes
- Create compelling demo scenarios

**Delivers**: Stable, demonstrable AI village simulation

## Quick Issue Creation Checklist

For each phase, when creating the GitHub issue:

### Required Elements
- [ ] Copy full template content from appropriate `.md` file
- [ ] Add appropriate labels (`phase-X`, `priority-level`, `type-implementation`)
- [ ] Set dependencies on previous phases (except Phase 1)
- [ ] Assign to development team members
- [ ] Link to project milestone if applicable

### Recommended Labels
```
Priority: priority-critical, priority-high, priority-medium
Phase: phase-1, phase-2, phase-3, phase-4, phase-5
Type: type-implementation, type-integration, type-testing
Component: component-ai, component-social, component-story, component-goap
```

### Issue Linking
- Phase 2 issue should reference Phase 1 as dependency
- Phase 3 issue should reference Phase 2 as dependency
- Phase 4 issue should reference Phase 3 as dependency
- Phase 5 issue should reference all previous phases as dependencies

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Phase 1 must be completed first** - all other functionality depends on it
2. **LLM response parsing must be robust** - 90%+ success rate required
3. **Performance monitoring** is essential throughout all phases
4. **Integration testing** should happen continuously, not just in Phase 5

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Starting Phase 2 before Phase 1 is fully tested and stable
- Underestimating the complexity of LLM response parsing
- Insufficient error handling for LLM failures
- Performance degradation as systems are integrated

### Success Metrics to Track
- **Decision Latency**: < 5 seconds per character turn
- **Memory Usage**: < 2GB for 10 characters over 1 hour
- **LLM Success Rate**: > 90% of responses successfully parsed
- **System Uptime**: > 99% stability during demo sessions

## Next Steps

1. **Create Phase 1 Issue**: Start with the core decision loop implementation
2. **Set up development environment** with proper testing framework
3. **Establish performance monitoring** from the beginning
4. **Plan integration checkpoints** throughout development

## Project Context

**Total Timeline**: 5 weeks (25 working days)
**Goal**: Working AI village simulation demo
**Architecture**: 10 modular components with complex integration points
**Technology Stack**: Python, LLM integration, FAISS, NetworkX, GOAP planning

**Current State**: Basic infrastructure exists but core AI decision-making is not connected to LLM system, blocking all intelligent behavior demonstrations.
