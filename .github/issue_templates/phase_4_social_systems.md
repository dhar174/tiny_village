# Phase 4: Social Systems

## Overview
Implement comprehensive social interaction systems that enable rich character relationships, group dynamics, and emergent social behaviors. This phase brings the village community to life through sophisticated social mechanics.

## Description
The social network exists in GraphManager but interaction logic is missing, preventing characters from forming meaningful relationships or engaging in conversations. This phase implements conversation systems, relationship mechanics, and group behavior patterns.

## Phase Goals
- Implement dynamic conversation system with context-aware dialogue
- Add relationship formation, maintenance, and decay mechanics
- Create social influence systems that affect character decision-making
- Enable group coordination and collective action behaviors

## Detailed Tasks

### 4.1 Social Interaction Engine
**Estimated Time**: 3 days  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 Complete

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement conversation system with dynamic topics
- [ ] Add relationship formation and decay mechanics
- [ ] Create social influence on decision-making
- [ ] Implement group behavior patterns
- [ ] Add reputation and status systems
- [ ] Create social conflict resolution mechanisms
- [ ] Implement cultural knowledge transmission

**Core Social Components**:
```python
class SocialInteractionEngine:
    def initiate_conversation(self, initiator: Character, target: Character) -> Conversation
    def generate_conversation_topics(self, participants: List[Character]) -> List[Topic]
    def update_relationship(self, char1: Character, char2: Character, interaction: Interaction) -> None
    def calculate_social_influence(self, influencer: Character, target: Character) -> float
    def detect_group_formation(self, characters: List[Character]) -> List[Group]
    
class RelationshipManager:
    def form_relationship(self, char1: Character, char2: Character, interaction_type: str) -> Relationship
    def update_relationship_strength(self, relationship: Relationship, interaction: Interaction) -> None
    def calculate_relationship_decay(self, relationship: Relationship, time_delta: float) -> None
    def get_relationship_effects(self, relationship: Relationship) -> Dict[str, float]
```

**Conversation System Features**:
- [ ] Context-aware topic generation based on shared experiences
- [ ] Emotional state influence on conversation tone
- [ ] Memory-based conversation continuity
- [ ] Personality-driven dialogue styles
- [ ] Group conversation dynamics with turn-taking

### 4.2 Advanced Social Behaviors
**Estimated Time**: 2 days  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Dependencies**: Task 4.1 Complete

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution mechanisms
- [ ] Add reputation and status systems
- [ ] Create social learning and adaptation
- [ ] Implement cultural transmission of knowledge
- [ ] Add social hierarchy and authority systems
- [ ] Create collective decision-making processes

**Advanced Social Features**:
```python
class SocialDynamicsManager:
    def resolve_social_conflict(self, conflict: SocialConflict) -> Resolution
    def update_reputation(self, character: Character, action: Action, witnesses: List[Character]) -> None
    def calculate_social_status(self, character: Character, community: Community) -> float
    def facilitate_knowledge_sharing(self, teacher: Character, learner: Character, knowledge: Knowledge) -> bool
    def manage_group_decision(self, group: Group, decision_context: Dict) -> Decision
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Characters can engage in natural, context-aware conversations
- [ ] Relationships form, strengthen, and decay based on interactions
- [ ] Social influences affect character decision-making patterns
- [ ] Group behaviors emerge from individual character interactions
- [ ] Reputation systems create meaningful social consequences
- [ ] Cultural knowledge spreads naturally through the community
- [ ] Social conflicts are resolved through realistic mechanisms

## Technical Requirements

### Conversation System Architecture
```
Conversation Trigger → Topic Generation → Dialogue Exchange
→ Emotional Processing → Relationship Updates
→ Memory Formation → Social Influence Updates
```

### Relationship Mechanics
- **Formation**: Based on interaction frequency and quality
- **Strength**: Influenced by shared experiences and personality compatibility
- **Decay**: Gradual weakening without regular interaction
- **Types**: Friendship, romantic, professional, familial, rivalry

### Social Influence Model
- **Trust Factor**: Based on relationship strength and past reliability
- **Authority Factor**: Based on social status and expertise
- **Personality Compatibility**: Similar personalities have stronger influence
- **Situational Context**: Influence varies by situation and topic

### Group Dynamics
- **Formation**: Characters with shared goals or frequent interactions
- **Roles**: Leader, follower, mediator, outsider
- **Cohesion**: Measure of group unity and shared purpose
- **Decision Making**: Consensus, authority-based, or democratic processes

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for conversation generation algorithms
- [ ] Relationship formation and decay simulation tests
- [ ] Social influence calculation validation tests
- [ ] Group behavior emergence tests
- [ ] Reputation system accuracy tests
- [ ] Performance tests with multiple concurrent interactions

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Characters engage in meaningful conversations
- [ ] Relationships evolve realistically over time
- [ ] Social dynamics influence character behavior
- [ ] Group behaviors emerge naturally
- [ ] System performance remains stable with multiple social interactions
- [ ] Demo scenarios showcase rich social dynamics
- [ ] Documentation covers all social systems

## Impact
This phase creates a living social ecosystem where:
- Characters form genuine relationships with emotional depth
- Social dynamics drive character motivations and decisions
- Community emerges from individual interactions
- Players witness realistic social evolution
- Group behaviors create emergent gameplay opportunities

## Dependencies
- **Requires**: Phase 3 (Event-Driven Storytelling) for narrative context
- **Blocks**: None (final functional phase)
- **Enables**: Rich community simulation and emergent social stories

## Social Interaction Types

### One-on-One Interactions
- [ ] Casual conversations and check-ins
- [ ] Deep personal discussions
- [ ] Collaborative planning sessions
- [ ] Conflict discussions and resolution
- [ ] Teaching and learning exchanges
- [ ] Emotional support interactions

### Group Interactions
- [ ] Community meetings and discussions
- [ ] Collaborative work sessions
- [ ] Social gatherings and celebrations
- [ ] Group problem-solving activities
- [ ] Cultural events and ceremonies
- [ ] Conflict mediation sessions

### Community-Wide Dynamics
- [ ] Information and rumor spreading
- [ ] Cultural norm establishment and evolution
- [ ] Collective resource management
- [ ] Community goal setting and achievement
- [ ] Social tradition development
- [ ] Reputation and status evolution

## Performance Considerations
- **Conversation Processing**: Efficient dialogue generation without delays
- **Relationship Updates**: Batch processing for multiple relationship changes
- **Memory Integration**: Efficient storage of social interaction memories
- **Scalability**: Support for growing community sizes

## Quality Assurance
- **Conversation Quality**: Ensure dialogues feel natural and contextually appropriate
- **Relationship Realism**: Validate that relationship evolution follows realistic patterns
- **Social Coherence**: Maintain consistent social dynamics across the community
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track system performance with increasing social complexity

## Estimated Timeline
**Total**: 5 days (Week 4)
- Task 4.1: 3 days
- Task 4.2: 2 days

## Priority
