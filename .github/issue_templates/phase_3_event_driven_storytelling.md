# Phase 3: Event-Driven Storytelling

## Overview
Implement dynamic narrative generation and story arc management to create emergent storytelling from character interactions. This phase transforms individual character actions into cohesive, compelling narratives.

## Description
The event handler exists but the storytelling system is marked "NOT_STARTED". This phase implements story event detection, narrative coherence tracking, and dynamic story arc generation to create emergent narratives from character interactions and world events.

## Phase Goals
- Implement story arc management and narrative coherence systems
- Create dynamic story event detection from character actions
- Enable emergent narrative generation from character interactions
- Establish character arc progression and story beat generation

## Detailed Tasks

### 3.1 Implement Story Arc Management
**Estimated Time**: 3 days  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 Complete

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create story event detection system
- [ ] Implement narrative coherence tracking
- [ ] Add story beat generation
- [ ] Create character arc progression
- [ ] Implement story theme management
- [ ] Add narrative pacing control
- [ ] Create story conflict generation and resolution

**New Components to Implement**:
```python
class StoryManager:
    def detect_story_events(self, recent_actions: List[Action]) -> List[StoryEvent]
    def generate_narrative_beat(self, event: StoryEvent) -> str
    def update_character_arcs(self, characters: List[Character]) -> None
    def maintain_narrative_coherence(self) -> None
    def identify_story_themes(self, events: List[StoryEvent]) -> List[Theme]
    def manage_story_pacing(self, current_tension: float) -> Dict
    def generate_conflicts(self, characters: List[Character]) -> List[Conflict]
```

**Story Event Types**:
- [ ] Character relationship changes (meetings, conflicts, alliances)
- [ ] Achievement events (goal completions, failures)
- [ ] Discovery events (new locations, items, information)
- [ ] Dramatic events (conflicts, resolutions, revelations)
- [ ] Environmental events (weather, seasonal changes)

### 3.2 Enhanced Event Processing
**Estimated Time**: 2 days  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Dependencies**: Task 3.1 Complete

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Extend EventHandler for story events
- [ ] Implement event propagation to MemoryManager
- [ ] Add event-based memory formation
- [ ] Create story-driven goal generation
- [ ] Implement narrative influence on character decisions
- [ ] Add story visualization and logging

**Event Processing Pipeline**:
- Action Execution → Event Detection → Story Classification
- Narrative Analysis → Character Arc Updates
- Memory Formation → Goal Generation → Story Logging

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System detects meaningful story events from character actions
- [ ] Narrative beats are generated that enhance the story
- [ ] Character arcs evolve based on their actions and experiences
- [ ] Story coherence is maintained across multiple interactions
- [ ] Emergent narratives arise naturally from character behavior
- [ ] Story events influence future character goals and decisions
- [ ] Narrative pacing adapts to maintain engagement

## Technical Requirements

### Story Event Detection
- **Action Analysis**: Identify story-significant actions
- **Relationship Tracking**: Monitor character relationship changes
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detect recurring themes and motifs
- **Context Awareness**: Consider environmental and temporal factors

### Narrative Coherence System
- **Theme Consistency**: Maintain thematic coherence across events
- **Character Consistency**: Ensure character behavior aligns with established traits
- **Plot Progression**: Manage story arc development and resolution
- **Temporal Coherence**: Maintain logical sequence of events

### Story Arc Management
```python
class StoryArc:
    def __init__(self, theme: str, participants: List[Character])
    def add_event(self, event: StoryEvent) -> None
    def calculate_progression(self) -> float
    def suggest_next_beats(self) -> List[StoryBeat]
    def check_resolution_conditions(self) -> bool
```

### Character Arc Progression
- **Growth Tracking**: Monitor character development over time
- **Motivation Evolution**: Update character goals based on experiences
- **Relationship Impact**: Influence character behavior through relationships
- **Achievement Recognition**: Acknowledge character accomplishments

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for story event detection algorithms
- [ ] Integration tests with EventHandler and MemoryManager
- [ ] Narrative coherence tests across multiple story arcs
- [ ] Character arc progression validation tests
- [ ] Story generation quality assessment tests

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Story events are reliably detected from character actions
- [ ] Narrative beats enhance rather than interfere with gameplay
- [ ] Character arcs show meaningful progression over time
- [ ] Story coherence is maintained across multiple sessions
- [ ] Performance impact on gameplay is minimal
- [ ] Story visualization tools are functional
- [ ] Demo scenarios showcase emergent storytelling

## Impact
This phase transforms Tiny Village from a simulation into a narrative experience where:
- Character actions contribute to larger story arcs
- Emergent narratives create emotional engagement
- Players witness meaningful character development
- Stories arise naturally from character interactions
- The world feels alive with ongoing narratives

## Dependencies
- **Requires**: Phase 2 (GOAP Planning) for complex character behavior
- **Blocks**: Advanced social dynamics that depend on narrative context
- **Enables**: Rich storytelling experiences and character development

## Story Types to Support
### Personal Arcs
- [ ] Character growth and self-discovery
- [ ] Skill development and mastery
- [ ] Personal goal achievement
- [ ] Overcoming personal challenges

### Relationship Arcs
- [ ] Friendship formation and deepening
- [ ] Romantic relationships
- [ ] Mentorship and learning
- [ ] Conflicts and reconciliation

### Community Arcs
- [ ] Collaborative projects and achievements
- [ ] Community challenges and solutions
- [ ] Cultural events and traditions
- [ ] Resource management and sharing

### Adventure Arcs
- [ ] Exploration and discovery
- [ ] Mystery solving
- [ ] Quest completion
- [ ] Overcoming obstacles

## Performance Considerations
- **Real-time Processing**: Story detection must not slow down gameplay
- **Memory Efficiency**: Store story data efficiently
- **Scalability**: Support multiple concurrent story arcs
- **Quality Control**: Ensure generated narratives are meaningful

## Estimated Timeline
**Total**: 5 days (Week 3)
- Task 3.1: 3 days
- Task 3.2: 2 days

## Priority
**HIGH** - Essential for engaging narrative experience

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 90% of significant character actions contribute to story events
- [ ] Story arcs maintain coherence over 30+ minute sessions
- [ ] Character arcs show measurable progression
- [ ] Generated narrative beats feel natural and meaningful
- [ ] Performance impact < 5% on overall system performance
- [ ] Demo sessions showcase compelling emergent stories
