# Phase 2: GOAP Planning Integration

## Overview
Integrate the Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) system with character decision-making to enable intelligent, goal-driven behavior. This phase builds upon the core decision loop to add strategic planning capabilities.

## Description
The GOAP system exists but is not integrated with character decision-making, preventing intelligent goal-driven behavior. This phase completes the GOAP implementation and connects it to the StrategyManager for autonomous planning and execution of action sequences.

## Phase Goals
- Complete the GOAP planning engine with A* pathfinding
- Integrate GOAP with the StrategyManager for goal-driven decisions
- Enable characters to plan and execute multi-step action sequences
- Implement goal priority weighting and plan validation

## Detailed Tasks

### 2.1 Complete GOAP System (`tiny_goap_system.py`)
**Estimated Time**: 2 days  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 Complete

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement A* pathfinding for action sequences
- [ ] Add goal priority weighting system
- [ ] Create action precondition validation
- [ ] Implement plan caching and revalidation
- [ ] Add plan optimization for efficiency
- [ ] Create debugging and visualization tools

**Key Components to Implement**:
```python
class GOAPPlanner:
    def plan_actions(self, character: Character, goal: Goal) -> List[Action]
    def validate_plan(self, plan: List[Action], world_state: Dict) -> bool
    def replan_on_failure(self, character: Character, failed_action: Action) -> List[Action]
    def calculate_plan_cost(self, plan: List[Action]) -> float
    def optimize_plan(self, plan: List[Action]) -> List[Action]
    def cache_plan(self, character_id: str, goal: Goal, plan: List[Action]) -> None
```

**Core Algorithms**:
- [ ] A* search for optimal action sequences
- [ ] Heuristic function for goal distance estimation
- [ ] Plan validation against current world state
- [ ] Dynamic replanning when conditions change
- [ ] Plan cost calculation and optimization

### 2.2 Integrate GOAP with Strategy Manager
**Estimated Time**: 2 days  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Dependencies**: Task 2.1 Complete

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Connect StrategyManager to GOAPPlanner
- [ ] Implement goal selection logic based on character state
- [ ] Add plan execution monitoring
- [ ] Handle plan interruptions and replanning
- [ ] Integrate with memory system for plan learning
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and optimization

**Integration Points**:
- `StrategyManager.decide_action()` → `GOAPPlanner.plan_actions()`
- Plan execution → Action validation → World state updates
- Plan failures → Automatic replanning
- Memory integration → Plan learning and adaptation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Characters can generate valid action plans for complex goals
- [ ] Plans are executed step-by-step with validation
- [ ] Failed actions trigger automatic replanning
- [ ] Goal priority system influences planning decisions
- [ ] Plan caching improves performance for similar situations
- [ ] Characters can handle multiple concurrent goals
- [ ] Plan execution integrates seamlessly with decision loop

## Technical Requirements

### GOAP Planning Flow
```
Character Goal → GOAPPlanner.plan_actions()
→ A* Search → Action Sequence
→ Plan Validation → Plan Caching
→ Step-by-step Execution
→ World State Updates → Plan Revalidation
```

### Goal Management
- **Goal Priority**: Weighted system for goal selection
- **Goal Types**: Survival, social, creative, exploration goals
- **Goal States**: Active, suspended, completed, failed
- **Goal Dependencies**: Hierarchical goal relationships

### Plan Execution Strategy
- **Step Validation**: Verify preconditions before each action
- **Failure Handling**: Automatic replanning on action failure
- **Interruption Support**: Handle plan interruptions gracefully
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor plan execution progress

### Performance Optimization
- **Plan Caching**: Reuse plans for similar situations
- **Incremental Planning**: Update plans rather than rebuilding
- **Parallel Planning**: Plan for multiple characters simultaneously
- **Memory Management**: Efficient storage of plans and goals

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for GOAP planning algorithms
- [ ] Integration tests with StrategyManager
- [ ] Performance tests for planning complexity
- [ ] Stress tests with multiple concurrent goals
- [ ] Edge case tests for plan failures and replanning

## Definition of Done
- [ ] GOAP system fully implemented and tested
- [ ] Integration with StrategyManager complete
- [ ] Characters demonstrate goal-driven behavior
- [ ] Plan execution is reliable and efficient
- [ ] Performance targets met for planning and execution
- [ ] Documentation and examples created
- [ ] Demo scenarios showcase intelligent planning

## Impact
This phase enables sophisticated AI behavior where characters can:
- Plan multi-step action sequences to achieve goals
- Adapt plans when conditions change
- Balance multiple competing objectives
- Learn from successful and failed plans
- Exhibit emergent strategic behavior

## Dependencies

- **Blocks**: Advanced social behaviors and storytelling
- **Enables**: Complex character interactions and emergent narratives

## Technical Challenges
- **Performance**: Ensure planning doesn't slow down gameplay

- **Robustness**: Handle dynamic world changes during plan execution

## Estimated Timeline
**Total**: 4 days (Week 2)
- Task 2.1: 2 days

## Priority
**HIGH** - Essential for intelligent character behavior

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Characters successfully plan and execute multi-step goals
- [ ] Planning latency < 2 seconds for typical scenarios
- [ ] Plan success rate > 80% in stable conditions
- [ ] Replanning handles world changes within 3 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended planning sessions
