# GitHub Issue Templates for Tiny Village Implementation

This directory contains comprehensive issue templates for the 5 major phases of Tiny Village implementation as outlined in the TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

## Overview

The Tiny Village project requires implementation across 5 critical phases to achieve a working AI village simulation demo. Each phase builds upon the previous ones, creating a complete ecosystem of intelligent agents, social dynamics, and emergent storytelling.

## Issue Templates

### Phase 1: Core Decision Loop Implementation
**File**: `phase_1_core_decision_loop.md`  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Duration**: 1 week (5 days)  
**Dependencies**: None

Implements the foundational AI decision-making loop connecting characters to the LLM system. This phase is critical as all subsequent functionality depends on characters being able to make intelligent decisions.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Complete Output Interpreter for parsing LLM responses
- Integrate LLM decision-making into character turn processing
- Establish reliable Character Turn → LLM Query → Action Execution flow

### Phase 2: GOAP Planning Integration
**File**: `phase_2_goap_planning_integration.md`  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Duration**: 1 week (4 days)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete

Adds strategic planning capabilities through Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP), enabling characters to plan and execute multi-step action sequences toward complex goals.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Complete GOAP system with A* pathfinding
- Integrate GOAP with StrategyManager
- Enable intelligent goal-driven character behavior

### Phase 3: Event-Driven Storytelling
**File**: `phase_3_event_driven_storytelling.md`  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Duration**: 1 week (5 days)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 complete

Transforms individual character actions into cohesive narratives through story event detection, narrative coherence tracking, and dynamic story arc generation.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Story arc management system
- Dynamic story event detection
- Character arc progression
- Emergent narrative generation

### Phase 4: Social Systems
**File**: `phase_4_social_systems.md`  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Duration**: 1 week (5 days)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 complete

Creates rich social interactions through conversation systems, relationship mechanics, group dynamics, and cultural knowledge transmission.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Dynamic conversation system
- Relationship formation and decay mechanics
- Group behavior patterns
- Social influence systems

### Phase 5: Polish and Integration
**File**: `phase_5_polish_integration.md`  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Duration**: 1 week (5 days)  
**Dependencies**: Phases 1-4 complete

Ensures system stability, performance optimization, and compelling demo scenarios that showcase the complete Tiny Village experience.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Demo scenario implementation
- System stability and robustness

## How to Use These Templates

### Creating GitHub Issues

1. **Copy Template Content**: Copy the entire content of the relevant phase template
2. **Create New Issue**: In GitHub, create a new issue in the repository
3. **Paste Content**: Paste the template content as the issue description
4. **Customize**: Adjust any project-specific details or requirements
5. **Add Labels**: Apply appropriate labels (priority, phase, type)
6. **Assign**: Assign to appropriate team members
7. **Set Milestone**: Link to project milestones if applicable

### Recommended Labels

- `phase-1`, `phase-2`, `phase-3`, `phase-4`, `phase-5`
- `priority-critical`, `priority-high`, `priority-medium`
- `type-implementation`, `type-integration`, `type-testing`
- `component-ai`, `component-social`, `component-story`, `component-goap`

### Issue Dependencies

Each phase depends on the previous phases being complete. Use GitHub's issue linking features to establish these dependencies:

- Phase 1 → No dependencies
- Phase 2 → Depends on Phase 1
- Phase 3 → Depends on Phase 2
- Phase 4 → Depends on Phase 3
- Phase 5 → Depends on Phases 1-4

### Tracking Progress

Each issue template includes:
- **Detailed task checklists** for tracking implementation progress
- **Acceptance criteria** for defining completion
- **Testing requirements** for validation
- **Performance targets** for quality assurance

Use these checklists to track progress and ensure comprehensive implementation.

## Implementation Sequence

The phases must be implemented in order due to their dependencies:

```
Phase 1 (Core Decision Loop)
    ↓
Phase 2 (GOAP Planning)
    ↓
Phase 3 (Event-Driven Storytelling)
    ↓
Phase 4 (Social Systems)
    ↓
Phase 5 (Polish and Integration)
```

## Expected Timeline

**Total Project Duration**: 5 weeks (25 working days)

- **Week 1**: Phase 1 - Core Decision Loop
- **Week 2**: Phase 2 - GOAP Planning Integration
- **Week 3**: Phase 3 - Event-Driven Storytelling
- **Week 4**: Phase 4 - Social Systems
- **Week 5**: Phase 5 - Polish and Integration

## Success Metrics

By the end of all phases, the system should demonstrate:

- ✅ Characters make intelligent, goal-driven decisions
- ✅ LLM responses are consistently parsed and executed (>90% success rate)
- ✅ Characters form and maintain realistic relationships
- ✅ Emergent stories arise naturally from character interactions
- ✅ System runs stably for 30+ minute demo sessions
- ✅ Actions feel natural and contextually appropriate

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Targets
- **Decision Latency**: < 5 seconds per character turn
- **Memory Usage**: < 2GB for 10 characters over 1 hour
- **LLM Success Rate**: > 90% of responses successfully parsed
- **System Uptime**: > 99% stability during demo sessions

### Quality Standards
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing
- Error handling prevents system crashes
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- Real-time performance monitoring
