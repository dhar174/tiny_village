# Suggest Awesome GitHub Copilot Collections

Analyze current repository context and suggest relevant collections from the [GitHub awesome-copilot repository](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/docs/README.collections.md) that would enhance the development workflow for this repository.

## Process

1. **Fetch Available Collections**: Extract collection list and descriptions from [awesome-copilot README.collections.md](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/docs/README.collections.md). Must use `#fetch` tool.
2. **Scan Local Assets**: Discover existing prompt files in `prompts/`, instruction files in `instructions/`, and chat modes in `agents/` folders
3. **Extract Local Descriptions**: Read front matter from local asset files to understand existing capabilities
4. **Fetch Remote Versions**: For each local asset that matches a collection item, fetch the corresponding version from awesome-copilot repository using raw GitHub URLs (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/awesome-copilot/main/<type>/<filename>`)
5. **Compare Versions**: Compare local asset content with remote versions to identify:
   - Assets that are up-to-date (exact match)
   - Assets that are outdated (content differs)
   - Key differences in outdated assets (tools, description, content)
6. **Analyze Repository Context**: Review chat history, repository files, programming languages, frameworks, and current project needs
7. **Match Collection Relevance**: Compare available collections against identified patterns and requirements
8. **Check Asset Overlap**: For relevant collections, analyze individual items to avoid duplicates with existing repository assets
9. **Present Collection Options**: Display relevant collections with descriptions, item counts, outdated asset counts, and rationale for suggestion
10. **Provide Usage Guidance**: Explain how the installed collection enhances the development workflow
    **AWAIT** user request to proceed with installation or updates of specific collections. DO NOT INSTALL OR UPDATE UNLESS DIRECTED TO DO SO.
11. **Download/Update Assets**: For requested collections, automatically:
    - Download new assets to appropriate directories
    - Update outdated assets by replacing with latest version from awesome-copilot
    - Do NOT adjust content of the files
    - Use `#fetch` tool to download assets, but may use `curl` using `#runInTerminal` tool to ensure all content is retrieved

**Installation Preview:**
- Will install to `prompts/`: 4 Azure-specific prompts
- Will install to `instructions/`: 6 infrastructure and DevOps best practices
- Will install to `agents/`: 5 specialized Azure expert modes

## Local Asset Discovery Process

1. **Scan Asset Directories**:
   - List all `*.prompt.md` files in `prompts/` directory
   - List all `*.instructions.md` files in `instructions/` directory
   - List all `*.agent.md` files in `agents/` directory

2. **Extract Asset Metadata**: For each discovered file, read YAML front matter to extract:
   - `description` - Primary purpose and functionality
   - `tools` - Required tools and capabilities
   - `mode` - Operating mode (for prompts)
   - `model` - Specific model requirements (for chat modes)

3. **Build Asset Inventory**: Create comprehensive map of existing capabilities organized by:
   - **Technology Focus**: Programming languages, frameworks, platforms
   - **Workflow Type**: Development, testing, deployment, documentation, planning
   - **Specialization Level**: General purpose vs. specialized expert modes

4. **Identify Coverage Gaps**: Compare existing assets against:
   - Repository technology stack requirements
   - Development workflow needs indicated by chat history
   - Industry best practices for identified project types
