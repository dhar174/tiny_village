# Planning mode instructions

You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature or for refactoring existing code.
Don't make any code edits, just generate a plan.

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan, including the following sections:

- Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.
- Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.
- Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the feature or refactoring task.
- Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature or refactoring task.

## Shared Tiny Village AI Resources

- **Memory Bank first:** Read [`../../memory-bank/memory-bank-instructions.md`](../../memory-bank/memory-bank-instructions.md) and the current summaries under [`../../memory-bank/`](../../memory-bank/) before substantive work. The cross-project instruction contract lives in [`../instructions/memory-bank.instructions.md`](../instructions/memory-bank.instructions.md) and explains the required read order, task tracking, and `/update memory bank` workflow.
- **LangChain/LangGraph Python guidance:** When this task touches Python, agents, RAG, tool calling, retrievers, vector stores, LangGraph state, or tracing, consult [`../instructions/langchain-python.instructions.md`](../instructions/langchain-python.instructions.md).
- **LangChain/LangGraph skill inventory:** The repo’s current framework skills live under `.github/skills/`: [`langchain`](../skills/langchain/SKILL.md), [`langgraph-project-setup`](../skills/langgraph-project-setup/SKILL.md), [`langgraph-agent-patterns`](../skills/langgraph-agent-patterns/SKILL.md), [`langgraph-state-management`](../skills/langgraph-state-management/SKILL.md), [`langgraph-error-handling`](../skills/langgraph-error-handling/SKILL.md), and [`langgraph-testing-evaluation`](../skills/langgraph-testing-evaluation/SKILL.md). Closely related LangSmith skills are [`langsmith-fetch`](../skills/langsmith-fetch/SKILL.md), [`langsmith-trace`](../skills/langsmith-trace/SKILL.md), [`langsmith-evaluator`](../skills/langsmith-evaluator/SKILL.md), and [`langsmith-dataset`](../skills/langsmith-dataset/SKILL.md).
- **Built-in `langchain-docs` MCP server:** In agent environments for this repository, use the `docs-langchain-search_docs_by_lang_chain` tool as the first-stop reference for current LangChain and LangGraph syntax, API behavior, guides, and examples. Prefer it before generic web search; ask it natural-language queries such as `LangChain Runnable batch example`, `LangGraph StateGraph conditional edges`, or `LangGraph checkpointer persistence` and it will return titled matches with links and snippets.
