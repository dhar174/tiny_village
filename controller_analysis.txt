Placeholder Systems:
- **`EventHandler` (`tiny_event_handler.py`)**:
    - The `documentation_summary.txt` describes `EventHandler` as detecting and queuing game events, which then trigger `StrategyManager`.
    - In `tiny_gameplay_controller.py`, `EventHandler` is initialized.
    - The `update()` legacy method calls `self.event_handler.check_events()`.
    - The main `update_game_state()` method does *not* appear to call the event handler to get new events. Instead, it has a `_process_pending_events()` method that iterates over `self.events`. How `self.events` is populated is not immediately clear in the main loop, though `_generate_action_events` and `_complete_quest` append to it.
    - The crucial documented role of `EventHandler` triggering `StrategyManager` via `MainApplication` (which is `GameplayController`) seems minimally implemented in the primary game loop logic. `_process_pending_events` itself has many TODOs and currently just marks events for removal.

- **`StrategyManager` (`tiny_strategy_manager.py`)**:
    - Documented to orchestrate high-level decision-making, use GOAP, and interact with LLM.
    - Initialized in `GameplayController`.
    - The legacy `update()` method calls `self.strategy_manager.update_strategy(events)`.
    - In `_execute_character_actions` (called from the main `update_game_state`), it calls `self.strategy_manager.get_daily_actions(character)`. This suggests it's being used to fetch actions, but the broader strategic decision-making loop (goal evaluation, planning based on events) as described in the data flow (points 2-5 in `documentation_summary.txt`) is not explicitly visible in `GameplayController`'s main update cycle. The controller seems to drive character updates more directly.

- **`LLM_Interface` (Conceptual: `PromptBuilder`, `TinyBrainIO`, `OutputInterpreter`)**:
    - The `documentation_summary.txt` mentions this as a conceptual component for LLM communication and parsing responses into game actions.
    - There are no explicit mentions or initializations of `PromptBuilder`, `TinyBrainIO`, or `OutputInterpreter` in `tiny_gameplay_controller.py`. This aligns with it being "conceptual" but indicates a significant gap if LLM-driven decisions are a core future feature. The `get_feature_implementation_status` also lists "advanced_ai_behaviors" as "NOT_STARTED".

- **`MemoryManager` (`tiny_memories.py`)**:
    - Documented as managing character memories with NLP and retrieval. The data flow states the `Character` records memories via `MemoryManager.add_memory()`.
    - In `_update_character_memory`, it calls `character.recall_recent_memories()`.
    - In `_update_character_state_after_action`, it calls `character.add_memory(memory_text)`.
    - While these calls exist, the depth of interaction (e.g., how memories influence `StrategyManager` or `GOAPPlanner` as per `documentation_summary.txt`) isn't evident from the controller's perspective. The controller facilitates calls to the character, but the memory system's integration into the broader decision loop is not directly managed or visible here.

- **`GOAPPlanner` (`tiny_goap_system.py`)**:
    - Documented as generating action plans. The `StrategyManager` is supposed to use this.
    - Not directly initialized or called by `GameplayController`. Its usage is abstracted within `StrategyManager` or `Character` objects.
    - The `documentation_summary.txt` highlights the `StrategyManager` -> `GOAPPlanner` -> `ActionSystem` loop. While `StrategyManager` and `ActionSystem` (via `ActionResolver`) are present, the GOAP planning step's prominence in the controller's logic is indirect.

- **Event-Driven Storytelling / Advanced AI Behaviors**:
    - Marked as "NOT_STARTED" in `get_feature_implementation_status`.
    - The `_process_pending_events` method has many TODOs related to event consequences, ripple effects, and event-driven story generation. This confirms the placeholder nature of complex event handling.

- **Economic Simulation**:
    - Marked as "STUB_IMPLEMENTED".
    - The `_update_economic_state` method has basic logic for wealth changes based on action names like "work", "buy", "trade". This is a very simplified placeholder for a full economic simulation.

- **Weather, Social Network, Quest Systems**:
    - All marked as "STUB_IMPLEMENTED" or "BASIC_IMPLEMENTED" but with many TODOs.
    - `implement_weather_system`, `implement_social_network_system`, `implement_quest_system` show very basic initializations and simple logic (e.g., random weather changes, basic relationship initialization, random quest assignment).
    - `_update_social_relationships` has rudimentary decay.
    - `_update_quest_timers` has basic logic for expiring and assigning quests.
    - `_update_quest_progress` has simple progress logic.
    - These systems are present but lack the depth described or implied by a full simulation game.

- **`ActionResolver` and `actions.py` Interaction**:
    - `ActionResolver` is well-developed within `GameplayController` for converting various action data types into executable actions. It has fallbacks and caching.
    - However, its `_dict_to_action` method creates a simple `Action` object with basic effects derived from `energy_cost` and `satisfaction` in the input dictionary. This might bypass more complex precondition/effect logic defined in `actions.py` if actions are primarily passed as simple dictionaries from `StrategyManager`.
    - The `_resolve_by_name` method attempts to use `self.action_system.generate_actions(character)` but falls back to `_dict_to_action`. The richness of the `ActionSystem` as described in `documentation_summary.txt` (with detailed preconditions, effects, costs) might not be fully leveraged if dictionary-based actions or simple named fallbacks are common.

- **`SystemRecoveryManager`**:
    - This class is quite detailed for recovering various systems by re-initializing them.
    - However, the recovery often involves creating new default instances (e.g., `StrategyManager()`, `ActualGraphManager()`). This would reset the state of these systems, which might be problematic for ongoing gameplay continuity. It's a recovery by replacement rather than state restoration.
