# Tiny Village Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the design documentation and existing codebase, this report identifies critical unimplemented features blocking a working demo and provides a fine-grained implementation plan. The architecture is well-designed with 10 modular components, but several key integration points and core systems remain unimplemented.

## Current State Analysis

### Implemented Components âœ…
- **Basic Infrastructure**: Core classes for Characters, Buildings, Items, Locations
- **LLM Communication**: `tiny_brain_io.py` with Transformers/GGUF support
- **Prompt Generation**: `tiny_prompt_builder.py` with descriptor matrices
- **Memory System Foundation**: `tiny_memories.py` with FAISS indexing
- **Graph Manager**: `tiny_graph_manager.py` with NetworkX MultiDiGraph
- **Time Management**: `tiny_time_manager.py` with tick-based progression
- **Basic Action System**: Action/Condition/State classes in `actions.py`
- **Game Controller Shell**: `tiny_gameplay_controller.py` main loop structure

### Critical Gaps Blocking Demo ðŸš«

#### 1. **Decision-Making Loop Integration** (CRITICAL)
- **Status**: Main character AI decision cycle is disconnected from LLM system
- **Impact**: Characters cannot make intelligent decisions
- **Location**: `tiny_gameplay_controller.py` lines 1800-2000 (process_character_turn). ALSO, `prompt_builder.py` needs to be fully implemented for decision prompts.
- **Current Coverage**: Only basic action execution without LLM input

#### 2. **Output Interpretation System** (CRITICAL)
- **Status**: `tiny_output_interpreter.py` has basic structure but minimal action mapping
- **Impact**: LLM responses cannot be converted to game actions
- **Current Coverage**: Only ~15% of defined actions have interpretation logic

#### 3. **GOAP Planning Engine** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Status**: `tiny_goap_system.py` exists but not integrated with character decision-making
- **Impact**: No intelligent goal-driven behavior
- **Integration Point**: StrategyManager â†’ GOAP â†’ ActionSystem chain broken

#### 4. **Event-Driven Storytelling** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Status**: Event handler exists but storytelling system marked "NOT_STARTED"
- **Impact**: No dynamic narrative generation
- **Components**: Event triggers, story arc management, narrative coherence

#### 5. **Social Interaction System** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Status**: Social network in GraphManager but interaction logic missing
- **Impact**: Characters cannot form relationships or have conversations
- **Dependencies**: OutputInterpreter, MemoryManager integration

## Critical Implementation Details

### Decision Loop Flow
```
Character Turn â†’ StrategyManager.decide_action()
â†’ PromptBuilder.build_decision_prompt()
â†’ BrainIO.query_llm()
â†’ OutputInterpreter.parse_response()
â†’ GOAPPlanner.validate_action()
â†’ GameController.execute_action()
â†’ MemoryManager.store_experience()
â†’ EventHandler.process_consequences()
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- **LLM Failures**: Fallback to rule-based decisions
- **Action Validation**: Reject invalid actions, request clarification
- **GOAP Planning**: Use cached plans or simplified goals
- **Memory Errors**: Log warnings, continue with partial data

### Performance Considerations
- **LLM Query Batching**: Process multiple characters simultaneously
- **Memory Optimization**: Implement memory cleanup cycles
- **GOAP Caching**: Cache and reuse valid action plans
- **Event Processing**: Use event queues to prevent blocking

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Priority
1. **OutputInterpreter**: All action parsing methods
2. **GOAPPlanner**: Planning algorithm edge cases
3. **StrategyManager**: Decision-making logic
4. **MemoryManager**: Memory storage and retrieval
5. **EventHandler**: Event propagation and processing

### Integration Tests
1. **Complete Decision Cycle**: From character turn to action execution
2. **Memory Formation**: From action execution to memory storage
3. **Social Interactions**: Multi-character conversation scenarios
4. **Story Generation**: Event detection to narrative creation

### Demo Scenarios
1. **Basic Survival**: Characters finding food, shelter, rest
2. **Social Interaction**: Characters meeting, forming relationships
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Characters handling disagreements
4. **Creative Collaboration**: Characters working together on projects

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **LLM Response Quality**: Implement response validation and retry logic
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitor and optimize critical paths
- **Memory Consumption**: Implement memory management strategies
- **Integration Complexity**: Use staged integration approach

### Schedule Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Maintain strict focus on demo requirements
- **Technical Debt**: Allocate time for refactoring in each phase
- **Testing Overhead**: Integrate testing throughout development

## Success Metrics

### Demo Readiness Criteria
- âœ… Characters make intelligent, goal-driven decisions
- âœ… LLM responses are consistently parsed and executed
- âœ… Characters form and maintain relationships
- âœ… Emergent stories arise from character interactions
- âœ… System runs stably for 30+ minute demo sessions
- âœ… Actions feel natural and contextually appropriate

### Performance Targets
- **Decision Latency**: < 5 seconds per character turn
- **Memory Usage**: < 2GB for 10 characters over 1 hour
- **Success Rate**: > 90% of LLM responses successfully parsed
- **Uptime**: > 99% stability during demo sessions

## Conclusion

The Tiny Village architecture is fundamentally sound, but requires focused implementation of 5 critical systems to achieve demo readiness. The proposed 5-week plan prioritizes the most impactful components first, ensuring early wins while building toward full system integration.

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Begin Phase 1.1: Complete OutputInterpreter action mapping
2. Set up comprehensive testing framework
3. Create daily integration checkpoints
4. Establish performance monitoring baselines

The modular architecture and existing foundation provide a solid base for rapid development. With focused execution of this plan, a compelling AI village simulation demo is achievable within the 5-week timeline.
