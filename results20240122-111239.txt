The first harvest will only happen when we have good soil and a healthy crop. That's why I need to be patient with them.

Tom: I'll head out to the fields first thing in the morning and gather the necessary resources, including grain and tools needed for repairing damaged farm tools. My goal is to return home by midday so that I can rest and recuperate before my next farm chores.

Tom: The market is coming up soon, and I'm excited to sell some of the produce grown on my farm. I plan to bring some dried fruit and nuts to add to my offerings. My aim is to make a profit while supporting other farmers in the area.
