# Fix for torch.rand Stub Issue #315

## Problem
The `torch.rand` stub always returned 0, which masked issues where randomness was expected and violated the principle of writing tests that fail when functions don't work as expected.

## Root Cause
The project was using torch functions without having a proper torch module implementation, leading to predictable (always 0) returns from `torch.rand()`.

## Solution
Created a comprehensive `torch.py` stub module that:

1. **Fixed the core issue**: `torch.rand()` now returns actual random values between 0 and 1
2. **Maintains compatibility**: All existing import patterns continue to work (`from torch import Graph, eq, rand`)
3. **Supports all tensor operations**: Handles various dimensions used in the codebase (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.)
4. **Provides additional functionality**: Includes stubs for other torch functions used in the codebase

## Key Changes

### New Files
- `torch.py`: Complete torch stub module with proper random value generation
- `test_torch_rand_fix.py`: Comprehensive tests verifying the fix
- `test_randomness_demonstration.py`: Demonstration of why the fix was necessary

### Code Behavior Changes
- **Before**: `torch.rand()` always returned 0
- **After**: `torch.rand()` returns different random values on each call

## Testing
All tests pass and demonstrate:
- ✅ Random values are generated correctly
- ✅ Tensor operations work with proper shapes
- ✅ Randomness-dependent code shows varied behavior
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing code
- ✅ Edge cases are handled properly

## Impact
- Tests will now properly fail when randomness-dependent functions don't work
- Mock embeddings and tensors have realistic variance
- No breaking changes to existing codebase
- Resolves the issue of tests passing when they should fail

This fix ensures that the principle of "tests should fail when functions don't work as expected" is properly upheld.
