"""
Depending on the type of planning (e.g., career, daily activities, relationship management), different nodes and edges are highlighted or prioritized during the analysis.
GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning)
Purpose: To create a series of actions that lead to achieving a specific goal.
Implementation Strategy:
Design a GOAP system that operates on a set of possible actions, each with conditions and effects that are defined generically enough to apply to various goals.
Implement action selection based on the current state of the world and the desired end state, using a cost function that might include time, resource expenditure, emotional cost, etc., which can adapt to the type of goal.
Utility Evaluation
Purpose: To assess and rank possible actions based on their expected utility.
Implementation Strategy:
Define a utility function that inputs various factors like character preferences, potential rewards, risks, and long-term impacts.
This function should dynamically weigh these factors according to the current planning focusâ€”whether it's deciding on a daily activity or a life-changing decision like a job change.

This module integrates the GOAP system and the graph manager to formulate comprehensive strategies based on events.
