# GOAP System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully addressed all requirements from issue #145 to complete the Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) system in tiny_village.

## Problem Statement Analysis
The original issue identified several gaps in the GOAP system:

1. **Core Planner Logic**: Needed unification between static and instance planning methods
2. **Action Definitions**: Required proper integration with Action objects from actions.py
3. **Character/World Integration**: Needed dynamic state and action retrieval
4. **Plan Execution Robustness**: Required enhanced Plan.execute() and Plan.replan() methods
5. **Cost Functions**: Needed proper integration in planning search
6. **StrategyManager Alignment**: Required fixing interaction between components

## Implementation Results

### ✅ Core Planner Logic - COMPLETED
- **Instance Method**: `plan_actions()` serves as the main sophisticated planning interface
- **Static Method**: `goap_planner()` maintained for backward compatibility 
- **Algorithm**: A* search with heuristic cost estimation and goal satisfaction checking
- **Consistency**: Both methods return identical results for same inputs
- **Testing**: Verified with multiple test scenarios including cost optimization

### ✅ Action Definitions - COMPLETED  
- **Compatibility**: Full support for Action objects from actions.py
- **Action Types**: Works with EatAction, SleepAction, WorkAction, and custom Action objects
- **Preconditions**: Proper checking with Condition objects and state validation
- **Effects**: Handles multiple target types, change values, and attribute modifications
- **Testing**: Validated precondition checking and effect application across action types

### ✅ Character/World Integration - COMPLETED
- **Dynamic State**: `get_current_world_state()` retrieves character state dynamically
- **Dynamic Actions**: `get_available_actions()` retrieves context-appropriate actions
- **Auto-Retrieval**: `plan_for_character()` convenience method handles automatic retrieval
- **Fallback System**: Provides basic actions when graph manager unavailable
- **Testing**: Verified state retrieval and action generation with mock characters

### ✅ Plan Execution Robustness - COMPLETED
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff and configurable retry limits
- **Enhanced Replan**: Generates alternative action sequences on failure
- **Failure Handling**: Intelligent recovery with alternative action finding
- **Progress Tracking**: Maintains completed actions and goal achievement status
- **Testing**: Validated failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms

### ✅ Cost Functions - COMPLETED
- **Cost Calculation**: `_calculate_action_cost()` integrates with utility functions
- **Heuristic**: `_estimate_cost_to_goal()` provides A* search guidance
- **Optimization**: Planning prefers cheaper, more efficient actions
- **Utility Integration**: Cost adjustments based on character state and utility
- **Testing**: Verified cost optimization chooses most efficient actions

### ✅ StrategyManager Alignment - COMPLETED
- **Integration**: StrategyManager properly instantiates and uses GOAPPlanner
- **Planning Interface**: Can request and receive valid plans successfully
- **Event Handling**: Event-based strategy updates work correctly  
- **Decision Making**: Job offers and daily planning fully functional
- **Testing**: Full integration tests confirm alignment

## Additional Improvements

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed syntax error in `tiny_prompt_builder.py` that blocked StrategyManager imports
- Added missing `UTILITY_INFLUENCE_FACTOR` constant to Plan class
- Resolved import dependency issues

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Improved logging for debugging and monitoring
- Better exception handling in planning algorithms

### Testing Infrastructure
- Created focused test suite (`test_goap_focused.py`) for targeted validation
- Created comprehensive test suite (`test_goap_comprehensive.py`) for full requirements validation
- Enhanced existing tests for better coverage
- All tests pass consistently

## Validation Results

### Test Summary
- **Basic GOAP Tests**: ✅ PASS (all core implementations verified)
- **Strategy Alignment Tests**: ✅ PASS (full integration working)
- **Focused Validation**: ✅ PASS (5/5 test areas)
- **Comprehensive Requirements**: ✅ PASS (6/6 requirements satisfied)

### Performance
- Planning algorithms complete efficiently for typical scenarios
- Cost optimization working correctly (prefers efficient actions)
- Fallback systems provide robustness when dependencies unavailable
- Memory usage reasonable with proper state management

## Usage Examples

### Basic Planning
```python
from tiny_goap_system import GOAPPlanner
from tiny_utility_functions import Goal
from actions import Action, State

planner = GOAPPlanner(graph_manager)
character = get_character("Alice")
goal = Goal(name="increase_energy", target_effects={"energy": 80}, priority=0.8)

# Automatic planning with dynamic state/action retrieval
plan = planner.plan_for_character(character, goal)
```

### Strategy Manager Integration
```python
from tiny_strategy_manager import StrategyManager

strategy_manager = StrategyManager()
character = get_character("Bob")

# Get daily actions sorted by utility
actions = strategy_manager.get_daily_actions(character)

# Plan daily activities using GOAP
best_action = strategy_manager.plan_daily_activities(character)
```

### Plan Execution
```python
from tiny_goap_system import Plan

plan = Plan("DailyPlan")
plan.add_goal(goal)
# ... add actions ...

# Robust execution with retry and replan capabilities
success = plan.execute()
```

## Conclusion

All requirements from issue #145 have been successfully implemented and validated. The GOAP system is now:

- **Unified**: Core planning logic integrated between static and instance methods
- **Compatible**: Fully works with Action objects from actions.py  
- **Dynamic**: Automatically retrieves current world state and available actions
- **Robust**: Enhanced execution with retry, replan, and failure recovery
- **Optimized**: Properly integrates costs and utility in planning decisions
- **Aligned**: Full integration with StrategyManager confirmed

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while providing significant enhancements in functionality, robustness, and integration.
