""" GOAP System Structure
Define Goals:
Goals are end states that the character aims to achieve. These could range from personal (e.g., improve a relationship, learn a skill) to professional (e.g., get a promotion, change careers).
Define Actions:
Each action available to the character should have conditions (requirements to be able to perform the action) and effects (results of performing the action). Actions are the building blocks of the plans that GOAP will create.
Planning Algorithm:
The planner takes the current state of the world (including the character's state) and a goal, and it generates a plan that outlines the sequence of actions needed to achieve that goal.
This involves searching through the space of possible actions to find a sequence that transitions the character from their current state to the goal state with minimal cost.
Integrating Graph Analysis
The graph analysis provides a dynamic view of the character’s world, including relationships, interests, and historical interactions, which are crucial for setting realistic goals and conditions for actions.

Example Steps for Integration:
Graph-Based Condition Setting:
Use the output from the graph analysis to set conditions for actions. For example, if the goal is to improve a relationship, the condition might be that the relationship strength is below a certain threshold.
Graph-Based Effect Prediction:
Predict the potential effects of actions on the character’s network by simulating changes in the graph. For instance, attending social events might strengthen certain relationships.
Feedback Loop:
Post-action, update the graph based on the outcomes, which then informs future GOAP planning. 

Further Development
Action Definitions: Further detail actions with specific conditions and effects based on the character’s attributes and the graph analysis.
Cost Functions: Integrate a cost function to select the optimal path among several possibilities.
Real-Time Adjustments: Allow the GOAP system to adjust plans in real-time based on new information or changes in the game state, using continuous feedback from the graph analysis.

3. GOAP System and Graph Analysis
Where it happens: goap_system.py and graph_manager.py
What happens: The GOAP planner uses the graph to analyze relationships and preferences, and formulates a plan consisting of a sequence of actions that maximize the character’s utility for the day.
