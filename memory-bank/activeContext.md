## Current Work Focus

- The repository currently centers on prompt-to-notebook generation with shared
  CLI and FastAPI entry points, plus a reusable LangGraph pattern library.
- Current maintenance work includes keeping the Memory Bank aligned with the
  actual codebase so future sessions do not rely on template placeholders.

## Recent Changes Reflected in the Codebase

- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` was updated to document the actual repo
  architecture instead of template bullets.
- The API layer includes guarded output-path resolution and bounded async job
  concurrency.
- Progress streaming exists through SSE with in-memory job queues.

## Immediate Next Steps

- Keep the remaining Memory Bank files aligned with verified repository state.
- Continue improving generation quality and validation without breaking the
  deterministic stub path.
- Preserve parity between CLI-driven and API-driven artifact generation flows.

## Active Considerations

- Some advanced API parameters are currently recorded in the manifest but are
  not yet wired into the live generation pipeline.
- Runtime QA is intentionally minimal right now; static validation and repair
  are the primary safeguards before packaging outputs.
- The SSE implementation is appropriate for single-server development, but not a
  distributed production event bus.
