## What Works

- CLI-based generation supports both deterministic stub output and live
  generator-graph execution.
- The FastAPI server exposes synchronous generation, async generation startup,
  health checks, static web UI serving, and SSE progress streaming.
- Pattern generators for router, subagents, and critique-revise workflows are
  implemented and covered by dedicated tests.
- Notebook composition, validation, repair, and export helpers are present.

## What Is Still Incomplete

- Runtime notebook execution checks are explicitly skipped for now; the current
  `runtime_qa_node` reports a placeholder success message rather than executing
  generated notebooks.
- Several advanced API request fields are tracked in the output manifest but are
  not yet fully integrated into live generation behavior.
- The Memory Bank task index exists, but no project-specific task files have
  been added yet.

## Current Status

- The package metadata in `setup.py` marks the project as alpha.
- The repository already contains substantial scaffolding for CLI, API, RAG,
  notebook export, QA, and pattern generation workflows.
- Memory Bank documentation is being brought from template placeholders to
  verified project-specific context.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Live mode requires external credentials and can fail if the environment is not
  configured.
- RAG retrieval degrades gracefully to empty context when the vector store is
  unavailable, which keeps generation running but may reduce quality.
- The SSE/job model uses in-memory queues and is not yet designed for
  distributed multi-server coordination.
