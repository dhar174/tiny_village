# Missing Elements for Minimal Tiny Village Demo

This document summarizes the gaps preventing a basic demonstration of the Tiny Village game.

## Missing Assets
- **Map image**: `assets/default_map.png` referenced in `tiny_gameplay_controller.py` but no `assets/` directory exists.
- **Buildings file**: default buildings are provided in code, but without a map image, `MapController` fails to initialize.

## Entry Point Inconsistency
- `README.md` instructs running `python main.py`, but no `main.py` is in the repository. The actual entry point is `tiny_gameplay_controller.py`.

## Required Dependencies
- Several tests and modules fail due to missing packages such as `pandas`, `networkx`, and `attrs`. Specific issues include:
  - `pandas`: Required by `data_processing.py` for handling tabular data. Missing this package results in the error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'`.
  - `networkx`: Used in `graph_manager.py` for graph operations. Missing this package results in the error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'networkx'`.
  - `attrs`: Required by `entity_manager.py` for attribute management. Missing this package results in the error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'attrs'`.
Without these dependencies, `GraphManager` and other systems cannot initialize, and tests such as `test_graph_operations.py` and `test_entity_attributes.py` fail.

## Placeholder Features
- Many systems noted in `get_feature_implementation_status()` within `tiny_gameplay_controller.py` are marked `NOT_STARTED` or `STUB_IMPLEMENTED` (e.g., quest system, social network system, weather system). These stubs do not provide functional gameplay.

## Test Failures
- Running the provided test suite results in numerous errors due to the missing dependencies and incomplete implementations.

A minimal playable demo would require at least:
1. Providing the missing `assets/default_map.png` image and any other essential resources.
2. Clarifying the correct entry point in documentation.
3. Installing required dependencies such as `networkx`, `pandas`, and `attrs`.
4. Implementing basic functionality for currently stubbed systems so that characters can act on the map without crashing.
