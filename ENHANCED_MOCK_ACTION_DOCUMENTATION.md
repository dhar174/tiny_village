# Enhanced MockAction Classes - Precondition Checking Implementation

## Problem Statement

The original MockAction classes across the test suite had `preconditions_met` methods that always returned `True`, which could mask real implementation bugs. This violated the testing principle: **"design tests that will only pass if the tested code works as intended and fail otherwise"**.

## Issue Description

When MockAction classes have preconditions_met methods that always return `True`:
- Tests pass even when real GOAP precondition checking is broken
- Implementation bugs are masked rather than exposed
- The GOAP system could ship with broken precondition logic undetected

## Solution: Enhanced MockAction Classes

The enhanced MockAction classes now implement **meaningful precondition checking** that matches the real Action interface behavior.

### Key Features

1. **Realistic Precondition Validation**: Instead of always returning `True`, the mock actually checks preconditions
2. **Multiple Precondition Formats**: Supports dict-style, callable, and Condition-like preconditions
3. **Fail-Safe Design**: Unknown or invalid preconditions fail safely to expose bugs
4. **Interface Compatibility**: Matches the real Action class interface

### Enhanced Precondition Checking Logic

```python
def preconditions_met(self, state=None):
    """Check if preconditions are met - meaningful implementation."""
    if not self.preconditions:
        return True
        
    for precondition in self.preconditions:
        if isinstance(precondition, dict):
            # Handle dict-style: {"attribute": "energy", "operator": ">=", "value": 50}
            attribute = precondition.get("attribute")
            operator = precondition.get("operator", ">=")
            required_value = precondition.get("value", 0)
            
            if state is None:
                return False  # Cannot verify without state
                
            current_value = state.get(attribute, 0) if isinstance(state, dict) else getattr(state, attribute, 0)
            
            # Check based on operator
            if operator == ">=" and current_value < required_value:
                return False
            # ... (other operators)
                
        elif callable(precondition):
            # Handle function-style preconditions
            if not precondition(state):
                return False
                
        elif hasattr(precondition, 'check_condition'):
            # Handle Condition-like objects
            if not precondition.check_condition(state):
                return False
        else:
            # Unknown type - fail safe to catch bugs
            return False
            
    return True
```

### Supported Precondition Formats

#### 1. Dictionary Format
```python
preconditions = [
    {"attribute": "energy", "operator": ">=", "value": 50},
    {"attribute": "hunger", "operator": "<=", "value": 0.5}
]
```

#### 2. Callable Format
```python
def energy_check(state):
    return state.get("energy", 0) >= 50

preconditions = [energy_check]
```

#### 3. Condition-like Objects
```python
class MockCondition:
    def check_condition(self, state):
        return state.get("energy", 0) >= 50

preconditions = [MockCondition()]
```

### Enhanced Files

The following test files have been enhanced with meaningful precondition checking:

1. **`tests/test_tiny_utility_functions.py`** - MockAction for utility testing
2. **`tests/test_llm_integration_isolated.py`** - MockAction for LLM integration testing  
3. **`tests/test_goap_implementations.py`** - Multiple MockAction classes for GOAP testing

## Benefits

### Before Enhancement (Naive Mocking)
```python
# This would always pass, masking bugs
def preconditions_met(self, state=None):
    return True  # Always passes - BAD!
```

**Problem**: If the real GOAP planner has broken precondition checking, tests would still pass because the mock always returns `True`.

### After Enhancement (Meaningful Mocking)
```python
# This actually checks preconditions
def preconditions_met(self, state=None):
    # Real checking logic that can fail
    return all(check_precondition(p, state) for p in self.preconditions)
```

**Benefit**: Tests will fail if the GOAP planner doesn't properly use precondition checking, exposing real bugs.

## Testing Demonstration

The enhanced MockAction classes have been validated with comprehensive tests that demonstrate:

1. **Correct behavior with no preconditions** - Returns `True` when no preconditions exist
2. **Proper validation of dict-style preconditions** - Checks all operators correctly
3. **Support for multiple precondition types** - Handles dicts, callables, and objects
4. **Fail-safe behavior** - Returns `False` for invalid inputs to catch bugs
5. **Realistic GOAP scenarios** - Shows how enhanced mocking catches broken planners

## Impact on Testing Quality

The enhanced MockAction classes ensure that:
- **Tests fail when implementations break** - No more masking of real bugs
- **Realistic testing scenarios** - Mock behavior matches real Action interface
- **Better bug detection** - Broken GOAP logic will be caught during testing
- **Maintainable test code** - Clear, documented precondition formats

## Conclusion

Enhanced MockAction classes with meaningful precondition checking provide much more reliable testing coverage for GOAP functionality. They follow the principle that **tests should fail when implementations break**, ensuring that real bugs are caught rather than masked.

This enhancement addresses the feedback that MockAction classes were too minimal and could cause tests to pass even when real implementations were broken.
